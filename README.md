# WarmRoast Easy Setup

## Linux

[Tutorial Video](https://youtu.be/c0ffjooX7Jw)

**Attention:** *Oracle Java 8 is required for this to work...!*

**UPDATE:** The only requirements to run WarmRoast now is JDK 8 and the ability to run the `java` command.

Do `./run.sh` to start WarmRoast. Enter the # for the corresponding server you are running.

**If you cannot identify the server (because they all look the same), you can either add an argument at the end of your `launch.sh` script like `--log-strip-color` or rename the JAR file.**
