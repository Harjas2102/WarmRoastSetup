# WarmRoast Easy Setup

## Linux
[Tutorial Video](https://youtu.be/c0ffjooX7Jw)

**Attention:** *Oracle Java 8 is required for this to work...!*

If you do not have Oracle Java 8, you can install it by running `./install_oracle_java8.sh`

Run `./run.sh` to start WarmRoast. Enter the # for the corresponding server you are running.

**If you cannot identify the server (because they all look the same), you can either add an argument at the end of your `launch.sh` script like `--log-strip-color` or rename the JAR file.**
